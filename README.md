# digital_music_store_demo_project
In this demo SQL project we create a database of an imaginary digital music store. Then we run quarries for different questions relevant to business insights.

The provided csv files and questions are in their respective folders. The Querries folders contatins the sql querries for the 11 questions and the Output folder contatins the outputs in xml format easily accessible via spreadsheet. The full database is available in the Database SQL folder. I encountered some problems while working in mySQL workbench. The solves are included in another folder as well.

The Summary Report is a .pdf file that potrays a final report generated from the demo project.
